# Why yet another pomodoro timer?

Because all the aesthetically pleasing apps are close-sourced and reference analytics or ad sites. (i.e. pomofocus.io, tomatotimers.com)

## Why not in rust?

Because oftentimes I don't have terminal open, just the browser. Having a browser + tab is lighter weight than terminal + app + browser
